"First-person Demo" level uses Unity's standard character which was removed from the package to avoid file conflicts (and also is an Asset Store requirement).

To get the level to work properly, just import 1-s person character back (Assets -> Import Package -> Characters).

Standard assets are also available on the Asset Store: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/32351

The SunShafts script comes from the Legacy Image Effects: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/legacy-image-effects-83913
